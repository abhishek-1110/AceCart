# AceCart

This is an e-commerce web app. This is my final year project work. This project uses MERN stack technology. The main functionality of this e-commerce web app is:
1. Login / Sign up
2. Add or remove cart items
3. Synchronization of cart data with users.
4. Keep track of Ordered items and having synchronization.
5. Users can fill up the form to get their order placed & delivered. Upon filling up the form two mails are generated using EmailJS. One is sent to user for their order confirmation & one is sent to seller.

MongoDB is used as Database for storing user information, cart information, order details.

* Special Mention: This project was not possible without the help of codeforinterview Flipkart Clone Playlist. Thanks to him.

UI of this web application is similar to Flipkart. Images are from Flipkart Also.
